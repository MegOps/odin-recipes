    <h1>The Simple Cake</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A cake is a baked dessert that comes in many 
    different shapes, sizes, and flavors. Typically, it is
     made of flour, sugar, eggs, and butter or oil, which 
     are mixed together to form a batter. The batter is 
     then baked in an oven until it rises and becomes 
     golden brown. Cakes can be plain or filled with 
     layers of frosting, fruit, or other ingredients. 
     The frosting can be buttercream, cream cheese, 
     whipped cream, or other types of frosting, and 
     can be flavored with chocolate, vanilla, fruit, or 
     other flavors. Cakes can be decorated with frosting, 
     fruit, sprinkles, or other decorations to make them 
     look festive and delicious. Whether it's a birthday 
     cake, a wedding cake, or a simple coffee cake, cakes 
     are a sweet treat that are enjoyed by people of all 
     ages and are often served at celebrations and special
    occasions.
