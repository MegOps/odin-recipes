<h1>The Simple Scrambled Eggs</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Scrambled eggs are a classic breakfast dish made by whisking together eggs and cooking them in a pan until they are cooked through and slightly fluffy. To make scrambled eggs, the eggs are typically cracked into a bowl, beaten until the yolks and whites are fully combined, and seasoned with salt and pepper or other seasonings of your choice. The eggs are then poured into a hot, greased pan and stirred constantly with a spatula until they begin to solidify. Some people like their scrambled eggs cooked until they are completely set, while others prefer them a bit runny. Scrambled eggs can be made in a variety of ways, from plain and simple to fancy and loaded with toppings such as cheese, herbs, vegetables, and meats. They are a quick and easy breakfast option that can be enjoyed on their own or as part of a larger breakfast spread.
